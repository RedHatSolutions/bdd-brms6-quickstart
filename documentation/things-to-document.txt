Features:
 - tomcat
 - BC and test app (order-service) uses their own m2 repositories for accurate testing

Features TODO:
 - eap6 (BC doesnt start properly, probly due to paths)
 - openshift support (opens sockets using cargo plugin that OS doesnt allow)
 - use drools-BOM as a dependency management import



Defects:
 - 6.0.3-redhat-4 doesnt contain the "kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars" in the public techpreview/all
   - this means a manual install of the webapp as downloaded from the Red Hat Support Portal
 - unable to deploy using eap-6 using cargo, resorted to using tomcat7 


Best Practices:
 - separate rule domain so you can version, release and manage it separately.
 - separate business-rules module so you can unit test your technical rules in a development environment and use CI to ensure their integrity
 - acceptance cycles the container, bpms and tested apps in the correct maven lifecycles, whilst keeping all state in the target folder to ensure integrity and consistency of the tests

How to install the dependencies (install folder scripts)


How the m2repos work - 
  ie. acceptance tomcat uses settings.xml and a target/bpms-repo as its local to ensure it doesnt just pick from the machine default,
      and the client app (sample-webapp) uses target/client-repo as its local, and http://localhost:8080/business-central/maven2 as its remote so it uses BPMS as a maven repo

KPIs??


Delivery Questionnaire?
1) Customer name + region
2) Delivering consultants
3) How long did it take to deliver in man days?
4) Did it meet the customers needs?
5) If no, what tweaks were required?
6) would you/customer be willing to contribute the tweaks?
